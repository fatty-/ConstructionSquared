---Next---
*update version string
multi-cell objects will now block placement of other things in the are they occupy
the paintbucket will no longer paint objects

---Needs to be done---

use -2 for blocked cell, need to make sure that it doesn't conflict with using paintbrush to delete
make sure undo/redo/paintbrush work with this - disallow paintbrush with objects, undo/redo also needs to be passed the cells that are overwritten by -2
what happens if the -2 overwrites a cell containing an object? - -2 overwrites occupied cell, end up with dead cells where the object used to be placed.
when the object is overwritten, need to get the object, get it's image size, and then remove all the cells related to it with the objectBlocking value

---Future releases---

--Java--

dynamic drop down to display the available mod tilesets, if it contains an info.txt file then display the text in a popup, support clickable url to mod thread from info.txt
zoom?
add crafting item into placeable objects, start misc objects category, agaran category?
circles?
gridThread the large undo/redo/paintbucket actions
find a good way to remove mappings to tiles that don't exist anymore without breaking compatibility

--Lua--
assure that all blocks can be placed in all circumstances, hoping for an API call

--Misc--
race structures for agaran
check for new stuff as updates happen
