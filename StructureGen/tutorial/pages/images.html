    Load Image - Loads a structure from a pair of image files.<br>
    Save as Image - Saves the structure as a pair of image files, one for the foreground and one for the background.  The file mappings.txt in the "configuration" folder contains the mappings for turning the color codes back to the tiles<br>
    Delete Image - Deletes the pair of images<br>
    Update Mappings - Updates the mappings.txt file with any new tiles or objects.<br>
    Reset Mappings - Resets the mappings.txt file.  This DOES NOT reset it to default, it simply clears the file and repopulates it with the current correct mappings.  <b>THIS MAY BREAK ANY SAVED IMAGES, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</b><br>
