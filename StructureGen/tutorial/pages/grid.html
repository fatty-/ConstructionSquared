    The grid is the top half of the program.  This is where you draw the structure that will be built ingame.<br>
    <br>
    You can begin drawing by selecting a tile (left box below the grid) or an object (right box below the grid).  Then use the left-mouse to click or drag the mouse across the grid to place whatever it was you've clicked.  The right-mouse button works the same way, except it will delete tiles or objects from the grid.
