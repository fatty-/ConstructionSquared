    Immediately below the grid, there are some buttons and to the right of the buttons there's some text.  This displays the current row or column/the maximum number of rows or columns.<br>
    <br>
    You can resize the grid with the buttons immediately above the grid.<br>
    ++ means increase-by-one<br>
    -- means decrease-by-one.<br>
    <br>
    The grid's size can't be smaller than 1x1, but there is no maximum size to the grid.  There is no performance penalty for building a larger structure - this mod will not cause lag no matter how large a structure you create - however larger structures will take longer to build.
