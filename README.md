ConstructionSquared
===================

A mod for the game Starbound.  This is a Java program that allows you to draw structures that can then be built in-game.  For more information, see the thread on the Starbound forums: http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?resources/construction-squared.1453/

Also, all the images in the StructureGen/images/buttons directory is the property of Chucklefish and are included for ease of use both for me and anyone using this mod.  Therefore, they are not covered by the GNU GPL v3 license the rest of this is under.
